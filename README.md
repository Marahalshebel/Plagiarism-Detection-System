# Plaigirism Detection System

For CS315 - Algorithm design & analysis #5262    
Instructor Dr. Renad Alsweed

In this project, we are working on detecting how similar two texts are in order to identify possible plagiarism. Plagiarism Detection is working by comparing a submission file against a selected document within subjects (scientific, literature, and academic).

## Used algorithms
Implemented in python.
- Naive Approach (algorithm1.py)
- Optimized Approach - Rabin Karp (algorithm2.py)

## How to use

To run both programs, we choose the algorithm file we want to run, then we change to desired length, and desired subject in the code by:

changing variables:  
- DataSet_Size to: "small" ~1200-1700 characters, "medium" ~4k-5k characters, "large" ~22k-30k characters

- Subject to: "Academic", "Literature", "Science" 
then we run the program chosen.
